=head1 NAME

Pod::Elemental::Transformer::Verbatim - Transform :verbatim regions into verbatim paragraphs

=head1 VERSION

version 0.001

=head1 SYNOPSIS

In your F<weaver.ini>:

     [-Transformer / Verbatim]
     transformer = Verbatim

Or in a plugin bundle:

    sub mvp_bundle_config {
        return (
            ...
            [ '@Author::YOU/Verbatim', _exp('-Transformer'), { 'transformer' => 'Verbatim' } ],
        );
    }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module acts as a L<pod transformer|Pod::Elemental::Transformer>, using
C<:verbatim> regions to mark sections of text for treatment as if they were
verbatim paragraphs. The transformer indents the contained text by four
columns, allowing the pod parser to treat them properly; see
L<perlpod/"Verbatim Paragraph">.

That is, this pod:

    =begin :verbatim

    Here is some text.

    =end :verbatim

Is transformed to:

        Here is some text

Note that a single paragraph can be simply noted with C<=for :verbatim> rather
than using C<=begin :verbatim> and C<=end :verbatim> lines.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=head2 format_name

This attribute (defaulting to C<verbatim>) is the region format that will be
processed by this transformer.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 transform_node

Given a pod document object, returns the object with all its children with
C<:verbatim> directives removed and appropriate content replaced with
L<Pod::Elemental::Element::Pod5::Verbatim> objects.
